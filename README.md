You can also use Docker to setup a new Pimcore Installation.
You don't need to have a PHP environment with composer installed.

### Prerequisits

* Your user must be allowed to run docker commands (directly or via sudo).
* You must have docker-compose installed.
* Your user must be allowed to change file permissions (directly or via sudo).

### Follow these steps

1. Initialize the demo project using the `pimcore/pimcore` image
    ``docker run -u `id -u`:`id -g` --rm -v `pwd`:/var/www/html pimcore/pimcore:php8.1-latest composer create-project pimcore/demo my-project``
1. Go to your new project
    `cd my-project/`
1. Part of the new project is a docker compose file
    * Run `` echo `id -u`:`id -g` `` to retrieve your local user and group id
    * Open the `docker-compose.yml` file in an editor, uncomment all the `user: '1000:1000'` lines and update the ids if necessary
    * Start the needed services with `docker-compose up -d`
1. Install pimcore and initialize the DB
    `docker-compose exec php vendor/bin/pimcore-install --mysql-host-socket=db --mysql-username=pimcore --mysql-password=pimcore --mysql-database=pimcore`
    * When asked for admin user and password: Choose freely
    * This can take a while, up to 20 minutes
