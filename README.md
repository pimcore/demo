## Getting started 
```bash
COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 composer create-project pimcore/demo my-project
cd ./my-project
./vendor/bin/pimcore-install
```

- Point your virtual host to `my-project/public`
- [Only for Apache] Create `my-project/public/.htaccess` according to https://pimcore.com/docs/platform/Pimcore/Installation_and_Upgrade/System_Setup_and_Hosting/Apache_Configuration/ 
- Open https://your-host/admin in your browser

## Docker

You can also use Docker to setup a new Pimcore Installation.
You don't need to have a PHP environment with composer installed.

### Prerequisits

* Your user must be allowed to run docker commands (directly or via sudo).
* You must have docker-compose installed.
* Your user must be allowed to change file permissions (directly or via sudo).

### Follow these steps

1. Initialize the demo project using the `pimcore/pimcore` image
    ``docker run -u `id -u`:`id -g` --rm -v `pwd`:/var/www/html pimcore/pimcore:php8.3-latest composer create-project --no-scripts pimcore/demo my-project``
1. Go to your new project
    `cd my-project/`
1. Part of the new project is a docker compose file
    * Run `` echo `id -u`:`id -g` `` to retrieve your local user and group id
    * Open the `docker-compose.yaml` file in an editor, uncomment all the `user: '1000:1000'` lines and update the ids if necessary
    * Start the needed services with `docker compose up -d`
    * Run `docker compose exec php composer install` to install the required dependencies
    * Install the assets by running the script `docker compose exec php bin/console assets:install --symlink --relative`
1. Install pimcore and initialize the DB
    `docker compose exec php vendor/bin/pimcore-install --mysql-host-socket=db --mysql-username=pimcore --mysql-password=pimcore --mysql-database=pimcore`
    * When asked for admin user and password: Choose freely
    * This can take a while, up to 20 minutes
1. Clear and warm up the cache with `docker compose exec php bin/console cache:clear`
1. :heavy_check_mark: DONE - You can now visit your pimcore-demo:
    * The frontend: <http://localhost>
    * The admin interface, using the credentials you have chosen above:
      <http://localhost/admin>

## Pimcore Platform Version
By default, Pimcore Platform Version is added as a dependency which ensures installation of compatible and in combination 
with each other tested versions of additional Pimcore modules. More information about the Platform Version can be found in the 
[Platform Version docs](https://github.com/pimcore/platform-version). 

It might be necessary to update a specific Pimcore module to a version that is not included in the Platform Version.
In that case, you need to remove the `platform-version` dependency from your `composer.json` and update the module to
the desired version.
Be aware that this might lead to a theoretically compatible but untested combination of Pimcore modules.
