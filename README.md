# Demo and Blue Print Application for Pimcore 6

This demo package is intended to be used by Pimcore newcomers who want to learn Pimcore and see it in action. 
It's tailored get an overview of Pimcores CMS, DAM, PIM and E-Commerce functionality and can be used as a blue print for 
E-Commerce Applications built with Pimcore. If you are an experienced Pimcore developer, have a look at the Skeleton linked below instead.

## Getting started 
```bash
COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 composer create-project pimcore/demo my-project
cd ./my-project
./vendor/bin/pimcore-install
```

- Point your virtual host to `my-project/web` 
- Open https://your-host/admin in your browser
- Done! ðŸ˜Ž

## Docker

You can also use Docker to setup a new Pimcore Installation.
You don't need to have a PHP environment with composer installed.

### Prerequisits

* Your user must be allowed to run docker commands (directly or via sudo).
* You must have docker-composed installed.
* Your user must be allowed to change file permissions (directly or via sudo).

### Follow these steps

1. Initialize the demo project using the `pimcore/pimcore` image
    ``docker run --rm -v `pwd`:/var/www/html pimcore/pimcore:PHP7.4-apache composer create-project pimcore/demo my-project``
1. Fix permissions of the created directory (we are already working on a fix to make this redundant)
    `sudo chown -R 1000 my-project/`
1. Go to your new project
    `cd my-project/`
1. Part of the new project is a docker compose file. Use it to start the needed services
    `docker-compose up -d`
1. Install pimcore and initialize the DB
    `docker-compose exec php vendor/bin/pimcore-install --mysql-host-socket=db`
    * When asked for admin user and password: Choose freely
    * When asked for DB credentials, use the following:
      * MySQL username: pimcore
      * MySQL password: pimcore
      * MySQL database: pimcore
    * This can take a while, up to 20 minutes
1. Fix permissions again, the installer has created new directories
    `sudo chown -R 1000 .`
1. :heavy_check_mark: DONE - You can now visit your pimcore-demo:
    * The frontend: <http://localhost>
    * The admin interface, using the credentials you have chosen above:
      <http://localhost/admin>
